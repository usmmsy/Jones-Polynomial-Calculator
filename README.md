# Jones-Polynomial-Calculator
This is an in progress project on creating an algorithm that could read hand sketched link diagram and calculate Jones Polynomial, a classic knot invariant, for the link presented in the picture
As of now I only uploaded two finished documents, one is a zip document consisting of selected knot diagrams from KnotInfo, and the other is a matlab program that would take in a picture of a nontrivial knot and count its crossing number, which is an important step in calculating Jones Polynomial invariant
